## Activity 1

1) Each team gets one algorithm and one implementation of it. The implementation is uncommented. Teams read the algorithm and try to add comments and documentation to clarify. 

1) Next, each team gets 10 minutes to read *another team's* uncommented algorithm implementation. They have to try to write up an explanation

1) Next, each team gets 4 minutes to read the other team's *commented* implementation.

1) Finally, each team presents what they think the other team's algorithm does, if/how commenting was easier to read, etc etc
