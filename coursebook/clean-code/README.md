## Activity 1

1) Form 4 teams. Each team gets one algorithm and one implementation of it. The implementation is uncommented.

1) Read the `README.md` and try to understand the algorithm. 
Then, try to rename variables, add documentation, and add comments to clarify the code.
Check in the commented code as `with_comments.js`.

1) Next, each team gets 10 minutes to read *another team's* uncommented algorithm implementation. They have to try to write up an explanation

1) Next, each team gets 4 minutes to read the other team's *commented* implementation.

1) Finally, each team presents what they think the other team's algorithm does, if/how commenting was easier to read, etc etc
